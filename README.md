#Abstract Bank Account
    This is a redo of my bank account application from
    bootcamp. I'm adding a Checking and Business account.
    

## Account
    The first thing I did was create an Abstract 
    called account. This will be the blue print for
    my Saving, Checking, and Business account.
    

## Savings
* Key Feature
    * ``As a banker, I would like an 
       intrest rate of 2.0 per withdraw charge 
       to my clients``

## Checking
* Key Feature
    * ``As a banker I only want my clients to
    to withdraw funds and have the option to view amount``

## Business
* Key Feature
    * ``As a banker, I want my clients to only
    deposit money greater than 15,000 and have a 4.6 interest rate per withdraw``
    
## Money Converter
    As a banker I would like my clients to have a
    money converter option.
